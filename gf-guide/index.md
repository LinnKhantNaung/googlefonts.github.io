# Google Fonts Guide

> ðŸ¦œ This guide aims to help people to navigate requirements and recommendations to contribute to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
This documentation is not meant to be read at once. For example, some people are more empowered with the use of Github and can skip some chapters, or you are only interested in how to make better outlines. The guidelines have been separated into small bits to facilitate the search of specific informations that you would need at a specific stage of the font production.
If youâ€™re a **type designer** and you want to **contribute** fonts to Google Fonts, whether commissioned or as a voluntary contribution, you should read the chapters marked with `Starting point` and `Must read`. Additional resources are available under the `Learn` label.
If you are **onboarding** fonts to Google Fonts, or for very advanced users, the chapters marked with `Team Member` and `Nerd` are for you.
