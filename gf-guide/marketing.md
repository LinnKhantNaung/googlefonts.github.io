# Promo / Marketing
{:.no_toc}

<div class="callout">

ðŸ¦• When a font is released for the first time on Google Fonts, or if it benefited from a major upgrade, we will promote it through social medias.
<br><br>
This guide provides specifications for the required images for your typographic project published on Google Fonts. The images will be added to the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ojuju/about">'About'</a> section of the specimen page on Google Fonts and can be used to promote the font on social media platforms (Mastodon, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram).

## Overall recommendations

- Use these images to showcase your font's main characteristics, design particularities, and any special features it might include. Don't hesitate to use compelling shapes and colors that could help users see its potential in different designs.
-   Please provide a compilation image plus one for each family when a project includes many sibling families. According to the project's complexity, we would decide on the strategy to promote them either as a set or independently.
-   If the font was designed for a particular script or language, some localized text should be added addressing the respective script or language.
- Do not include images that could be considered sensitive or offensive for social or political reasons (nothing that could be related to violence of any kind).

### Credits/content:
- Please be sure that you have all the credits for images
- Do not include images you don't own 100% of the rights to
- Do not add credits of any kindâ€”not for yourself (they will be already included in the Designers section) or for third parties.
- These images will be licensed under the CC https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/



## Repository structure and /documentation folder

-   Both the images and the source files of the images should be included in the promo folder under the documentation dir.
-   Authorsâ€™ names will be included, preferable by tagging them. Person tags can be provided in the README.md or a .txt file in documentation dir.
-   The images license (CC-by-SA) will appear in a .txt folder. See the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefonts-project-template/tree/main/documentation"> repository template</a>.
-   Feel free to add these images to your repo's README.md section (in the /documentation folder).
